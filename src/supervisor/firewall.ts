/**
 * Loopback port guard: an iptables OUTPUT owner-match rule that lets only the
 * orchestrator (root) open a connection to a per-user DSH's loopback RPC port.
 * Because every user DSH binds the shared 127.0.0.1 loopback on a dynamic port,
 * a co-tenant local user could otherwise `curl` another user's DSH directly and
 * bypass the orchestrator's session authentication. The owner match filters on
 * the *client* uid, which is only observable on the OUTPUT chain for a
 * same-host loopback connection (an INPUT rule would see the receiving DSH's
 * uid and block nothing selectively).
 *
 * The REJECT is inserted at the *top* of OUTPUT (`-I OUTPUT 1`), not appended:
 * iptables stops at the first match, so an earlier ACCEPT (ufw or a conntrack
 * `ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT`) would otherwise swallow the packet before an
 * appended `-A` REJECT is ever evaluated.
 *
 * Linux + root only; opt in via `config.portGuard` and fail loud when enabled
 * on a host that cannot apply it.
 * @module dsh-server-login/supervisor/firewall
